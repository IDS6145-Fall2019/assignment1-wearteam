## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

'''
Discrete event simulation is needed to solve this problem. Discrete event simulation is useful for discovering how much
of a resource, or set of resources, a decision maker (in this case, the smart city algorithm) needs to initiate an
action. For the subway queueing simulation, the decision to modify the number of available ticket kiosks is made by
assessing the number of passengers waiting in line to buy a ticket. Agent based simulation is also useful for solving
this problem. Passengers make multiple decisions when purchasing a subway ticket. The first decision is whether or not
they want to ride the subway (based on ticket kiosk wait time). The second decision is which line best helps them reach
their goal (minimizing wait time to buy a ticket). For this simulation we will presume that every passenger intends to
buy a ticket and will pick the shortest available ticket kiosk line.

This simulation type was chosen because the decisions and actions of buying a subway ticket are easily divided into
discrete steps: enter ticket kiosk area, decide to purchase ticket, choose the optimal queue to wait in, enter queue,
wait in the queue, purchase ticket, exit ticket kiosk area
