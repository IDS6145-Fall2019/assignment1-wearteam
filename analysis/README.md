## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: Define what category  (or combination of categories) of simulation needed to solve this problem.)
'''
Discrete event simulation is needed to solve this problem. Discrete event simulation is useful for discovering how much
of a resource, or set of resources, a decision maker (in this case, the smart city algorithm) needs to initiate an
action. For the subway queueing simulation, the decision to modify the number of available ticket kiosks is made by
assessing the number of passengers waiting in line to buy a ticket
